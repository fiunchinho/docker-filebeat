################### Filebeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Filebeat ######################################
filebeat:
  # List of prospectors to fetch data.
  prospectors:
    # Each - is a prospector. Below are the prospector specific configurations
    -
      # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
      # To fetch all ".log" files from a specific level of subdirectories
      # /var/log/*/*.log can be used.
      # For each file found under this path, a harvester is started.
      # Make sure not file is defined twice as this can lead to unexpected behaviour.
      paths:
        - "-"

      # Configure the file encoding for reading file with international characters
      # supported encodings:
      #   plain, utf-8, utf-16be-bom, utf-16be, utf-16le, big5, gb18030, gbk, hzgb2312,
      #   euckr, eucjp, iso2022jp, shiftjis, iso8859-63, iso8859-6i, iso8859-8e,
      #   iso8859-8i
      encoding: utf-8

      # Type of the files. Based on this the way the file is read is decided.
      # The different types cannot be mixed in one prospector
      #
      # Possible options are:
      # * log: Reads every line of the log file (default)
      # * stdin: Reads the standard in
      type: stdin

      # Optional additional fields. These field can be freely picked
      # to add additional information to the crawled log files for filtering
      #fields:
      #  level: debug
      #  review: 1

      # Ignore files which were modified more then the defined timespan in the past
      # Time strings like 2h (2 hours), 5m (5 minutes) can be used.
      #ignore_older:

      # Scan frequency in seconds.
      # How often these files should be checked for changes. In case it is set
      # to 0s, it is done as often as possible. Default: 10s
      scan_frequency: 0s

      # Defines the buffer size every harvester uses when fetching the file
      #harvester_buffer_size: 16384

      # Always tail on log rotation. Disabled by default
      # Note: This may skip entries
      #tail_on_rotate: false

  # General filebeat configuration options
  #
  # Event count spool threshold - forces network flush if exceeded
  #spool_size: 1024

  # Defines how often the spooler is flushed. After idle_timeout the spooler is
  # Flush even though spool_size is not reached.
  #idle_timeout: 5s

  # Name of the registry file. Per default it is put in the current working
  # directory. In case the working directory is changed after when running
  # filebeat again, indexing starts from the beginning again.
  #registry_file: .filebeat

  # Full Path to directory with additional prospector configuration files. Each file must end with .yml
  # These config files must have the full filebeat config part inside, but only
  # the prospector part is processed. All global options like spool_size are ignored.
  # The config_dir MUST point to a different directory then where the main filebeat config file is in.

############################# Output ##########################################

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by filebeat.
# You can enable one or multiple outputs by setting enabled option to true.
output:
#  file:
#    enabled: true
#    path: "/packetbeat"
#    filename: packetbeat
#    rotate_every_kb: 1000
#    number_of_files: 7
  ### Logstash as output
  logstash:
    # Uncomment out this option if you want to output to Logstash. The default is false.
    enabled: true

    # The Logstash hosts
    hosts: ["LOGSTASH_HOST:LOGSTASH_PORT"]

    # Optional load balance the events between the Logstash hosts
    #loadbalance: true

    # Optional index name. The default index name is filebeat.
    #index: filebeat

    # Optional TLS. The default is on
    tls:
      disabled: true

      # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
      #certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]

      # Certificate for TLS client authentication
      #certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

      # Client Certificate Key
      #certificate_key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

      # Controls whether the client verifies server certificates and host name.
      # If insecure is set to true, all server host names and certificates will be
      # accepted. In this mode TLS based connections are susceptible to
      # man-in-the-middle attacks. Use only for testing.
      #insecure: true

      # Configure cipher suites to be used for TLS connections
      #cipher_suites: []

      # Configure curve types for ECDHE based cipher suites
      #curve_types: []

############################# Shipper #########################################

shipper:
  # The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
  # all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
  # If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
  #name:

  # The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
  # transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
  # logical properties.
  #tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

  # Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
  # by the server on which the shipper is installed. This option is useful
  # to remove duplicates if shippers are installed on multiple servers.
  #ignore_outgoing: true


############################# Logging #########################################

#  selectors: []
